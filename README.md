For my ENGG 200 course, a design course.

The challenge was to make a design with the raspberry pi pico that would interact with an api and artistically represent the data.

The raspberry pi pico connects to the internet, then authorizes itself with the spotify web api. Using the spotify web api, the top 3 songs of each countrys' daily top 50 songs are retrieved. 
The relative popularity of a song is then retrieved.
The program prints the country name and then each song name on the LCD display screen, while simultaneously lighting up the led strip a proportionate amount to represent the popularity.

Uses an api, the raspberry pi pico, and peripherals.
